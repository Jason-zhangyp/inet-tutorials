@mainpage Visualization Tutorial for the INET Framework
In this tutorial we show you, how to use the visualization module in the INET Framework.
The tutorial contains a series of simulation models, numbered from 1 through 24.
The models are of increasing complexity â€“ they start from the basics and in each step, they introduce new INET features and concepts related to visualization module.
Our goal is show the working of the visualization module and its submodules in INET.

This is an advanced tutorial, and it assumes that you are familiar with creating and running simulations in @opp and  INET.
If you aren't, you can check out the <a href="https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/tictoc-tutorial/" target="_blank"> TicToc Tutorial</a> to get started with using @opp. The <a href="../../../doc/walkthrough/tutorial.html" target="_blank"> INET Walkthrough</a> is an introduction to INET and working with protocols.

If you need more information at any time, feel free to refer to the @opp and INET documentation:

- <a href="https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/usman.html" target="_blank">@opp User Manual</a>
- <a href="https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/api/index.html" target="_blank">@opp API Reference</a>
- <a href="https://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/inet-manual-draft.pdf" target="_blank">INET Manual draft</a>
- <a href="https://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/neddoc/index.html" target="_blank">INET Reference</a>

In the tutorial, each step is a separate configuration in the same omnetpp.ini file.
Steps build on each other, they extend the configuration of the previous step by adding a few new lines.
Consecutive steps mostly share the same network, defined in NED.
