## Goals
The default visualization of OMNeT++ already displays message sends, methods calls, etc.
These are rather low level details compared to the domain specific visualization of INET.
The complex state and behavior of communication protocols provide much more opportunity
for visualizations. In the first step we create a model with INET visualizations enabled.

## The model
