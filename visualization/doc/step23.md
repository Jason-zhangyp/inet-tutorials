title: Step 23. Visualizing handovers
tutorial: Visualization

## Goals

A handoff occurs when a client moves beyond the radio range of one access point, 
and into the range of another access point. In general, it's difficult to tell 
which nodes are associated with which access points. In this step we display 
handovers.

A handover happens when a client moves beyond the radio range of one access point,
and into the range of another. The association state can be visualized, and this
step shows what happens during a handover, i.e. how the association state changes.
