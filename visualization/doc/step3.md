## Goals
Even though it's possible to express the position of network nodes, the movement of mobile nodes,
the geometry of physical objects using geographic locations, internally INET uses a Cartesian
coordinate system called the playground. Such coordinates may appear in the runtime GUI or the
simulation log or even in the debugger. To help you deal with that, in this step we show the
playground along with its coordinate axes.
